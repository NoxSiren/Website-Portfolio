        <p>My name is Jacqueline Hawker. I am a military spouse and I have two loving pets, a cat and dog!
            The purpose of this little project is to display my skills in HTML and CSS! This is a web page I built from scratch, to test what I have learned so far.
            I believe that this is a great opportunity to display some skills I have gained in my Bootcamp class.
        </p>
        <p>I have a strong basic understanding of HTML and CSS coding! 
            I am an extremly eager individual willing to learn more and be the best I can be in this skill.  
        </p>
        <p>I hope that this page can give anyone viewing it a descriptive understanding of who I am as a person and what I have accomplished in my life.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
        <section id="about"> 
            <div><image src="./Assets/Images/diamond.jpg" class="img2" width="400" height="200" alt="A diamond being held by tweezers."></image>

        <p>I am currently 27 years old. I moved a lot growing up in a military family. I have lived in several states and Australia.
            I am now a military spouse and have been married for 6 years. I met my spouse in North Carolina and moved to Washington state shortly after my spouse's deployment ended.
            We stayed in Washington for 2 years and are now currntly located in Colorado. My spouse hopes to move back to North Carolina before the end of 2022, so finding a felxible job is a high priority for me. 
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>I have been in retail for 10 years and have devloped genuine customer service skills and excellent communication with my teammates.
            I started my journey at Kohl's when I was 17. I worked with them for 4 years, branching off into jewelry sales 2 years into my time with the company.
            Taking the basic skills I had learned, I applied for Zale's and became apart of the <a href="https://www.signetjewelers.com/our-company/default.aspx" target="_blank">Signet</a> family.
        </p>
        <p>I have worked for Signet for 6 years now and transferred from Zale's to Jared the Galleria of Jewelry.
            Over my years with Signet they have paid for certification courses for me to expand my technical knowledge on diamonds.
            I am certified in Diamontology by the <a href="https://dcalearning.org/about/" target="_blank">Diamond Council of America</a> in 2019 and, most recently, completed the Diamond Essentials course by <a href="https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/about-gia/" target="_blank">Gemological Science International</a> in 2021.
            These certifications do not need to be renewed annually.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <section id="experience">
        <div><image src="./Assets/Images/GSI.jpeg" class="img" width="350" height="250" alt="Certificate of completion from GSI."></image>
        

        <p>I have been with my current employer, <a href="https://www.signetjewelers.com/our-company/default.aspx" target="_blank">Signet Jewelers</a>, for 6 years and have earned several certificatons through the company.
            I am willing to show any comapny that they will have my full dedication and hard work to prove that I am willing to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>Still being fairly new to this line of work, I do hope that the projects provided will show that I have enough knowledge and skill to show my growth in this industry.
            Some finished projects are:
            <ul>
                <li class="projects"><a href="https://github.com/NoxSiren/prework-about-me" target="_blank">Introduction Site</a></li>
                <li class="projects"><a href="https://github.com/NoxSiren/Refactor" target="_blank">Code Refactoring</a></li>
                <li class="projects">Password Generator</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I hope to consistantly expand my knowledge in this career and show that I am a hard worker.
            I put my all into everything that I do and get along as best as I can with my teammates. 
            Though I am very proud of my accomplishments in my current line of work, I want to challenge myself further by learning a new skill and excelling in this line of work.
